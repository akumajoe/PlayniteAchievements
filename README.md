> ## Quick Notes For Users Of This Fork
>
>- If you need setup instructions for Steam, GOG, Epic, RetroAchievements, PSN, Xbox, RPCS3, ShadPS4, Xenia, or Exophase, use the upstream wiki first.
>- If you are using this fork specifically for Local support, the main differences are the Local provider, Local overrides, Local compatibility fixes, and Local-focused refresh / notification work listed above.
>
>
> I'm not a developer, I'm a troubleshooting guy, so everything is made with LLM

# What This Fork Focuses On

- Local save support and local achievement
- No need for a steam account to gather the achievements schema
  - There is the option to select between Steam ( API ), SteamHunters and Completionist.me
- Compatibility work for non-standard Steam and local setups
  - If you are using Steam local saves ( GreenLuma or SteamTools, for example) the game will be detected as been from steam, you will need to override the provider to Local
- Per-game Local overrides inside Game Options
- Faster access to saved refresh presets from the main sidebar refresh selector
- Local-only realtime monitoring and notification improvements
- Add all the local achievements' games with the corresponding metadata
- Local Achievement Notification
- `SuccessStory` Import
- Theme and `StartPage` migration

Guides available in [Achievement Notifications Guide](ACHIEVEMENT_NOTIFICATIONS_GUIDE.md) and [Local Provider Troubleshooting](LOCAL_PROVIDER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

## Local Provider Folder List And Browse Flow

You can set any custom folder where you have saves located in your system as exception to never detect achievements from it

## Local Game Options Overrides

If you Right-click the game it will show a quicker way to do these changes:

<img src="Images/LocalAchivementsRightClickOptions.png" alt="Sidebar single-game view" width="900">

From the PlayniteAchievements menu inside the game

## Local Achievements' Games import and `SuccessStory Import`

This is a way of adding all of those achievements that are in the folders ina  way that it isn't needed to go through the folders and adding one by one.

There is also the option to import data from `SuccessStory`. This will go through all the JSON files in the selected SuccessStory folder and import the `Local` games and also the achievements for the games that were detected in them.

## Local Achievement Notification

This was a request from a user to have a sound playing when an achievement is unlocked while playing a game.<br>
Extra sounds in the [Resources/AdditionalSounds](source/Resources/AdditionalSounds)<br>
A notification for when the game that is been played has a new achievement unlocked.<br>
You can customize the overlay or use one of the provided themes.<br>
You can enable / disable the `Achievement Notification` in the right click  menu for each game.

## `StartPage` and Themes compatibility

In the `Theme Migration` tab you will have the possibility to make theme compatible with this fork, and that's also for theme that already support the original PlayniteAchievements fork, they still need to go through the `Theme Migration` since they are point to the other repo and not this one

There is also the `StartPage Compatibility` so the `Local` achievements appear in the `StartPage` extension when `PlayniteAchievements` is selected

- Added anonymous Steam metadata lookup for the Local provider without requiring Steam API access, including selectable SteamHunters and Completionist.me source priority in Local settings.
- Changed the Steam-mode anonymous fallback flow to prefer SteamHunters first, with Steam Community kept only as a later title-based fallback and old Community-first configs remapped away from that path.
- Improved Local schema matching, hidden-achievement handling, and metadata enrichment for anonymous Steam sources so titles, descriptions, icons, and hidden flags resolve more reliably when public data is available.

- Fixed custom refresh UI freezes by moving expensive target-estimation work off the UI thread.

### 2026-04-15

- Added Local unlock notifications with sound playback.

### 2026-04-11

- Fixed Local save handling for RUNE and OnlineFix layouts.
